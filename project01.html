      <h1>'Untitled Adventure Game Development Project'</h1>
      <h2>The following project is one that I've been wanting to make for a long time now. Originally inspired by Earthbound and the Paper Mario series, 
        I wanted to make a game that could capture a similar sense of wonder that captivated me as a kid.

      <h1>Starting out</h1>
      <p>
        The initial version of the project was made in Godot 3, but I started porting it over to Godot 4 during the alpha phase of the engine in the 
        Summer of 2022, not knowing how much longer it would be until the final version was released. This wasn't the best idea, because it meant that 
        my projects would break often while changes to the engine were being made. As a result, progress was stunted because most of my time was spent 
        trying to understand the engine's undocumented libraries and adapting the game's scripts.
        <br><br>
        I wanted to begin development with the intention of building an 'emotional prototype,' a brilliant idea from the minds behind 'Outer Wilds'. 
        In short, defining the atmosphere and feeling that I want the game to convey. As an artist, this allowed me to put most of my time into the game's 
        art direction and music.

      <h1>Art direction and issues</h1>
      <p>
        The game's art direction is inspired by the Nintendo DS and games like Pokemon, along with the Mother series and many other games from the early 
        2000s and late 1990s. I knew I wanted to combine 2D pixel art with 3D environments, and this meant a lot of time would need to be spent developing 
        shaders to render scenes appropriately. Certain design decisions, such as using fixed camera angles, were put in place to sell the effect. 
        <br><br>
        The biggest hurdle thus far regarding the graphics has been animation, which is very time consuming to get right. Also, due to entities being 
        2-dimensional, I would need to draw each animation (idle, running, jumping, etc.) from 8 different viewing angles. Really, I only needed to animate 
        from 5 viewing angles, because the remaining 3 could simply be mirrored across the Y axis. Even still, this would take an enormous amount of time 
        to get looking right. As shown in the video above, I tried getting around this by using a 3D model for the body, rendered at a low resolution in 
        combination with a screen-space outline shader I wrote; however, I experienced issues with facial features not showing up properly, so I opted to 
        use a 2D sprite for the head to maintain sharpness and clarity.

      <h1>Tracing everything</h1>
      <p>
        While this worked decently enough, I wasn't satisfied with the outlining around the character's limbs, and I ultimately decided to render each 
        animation of the model from 8 viewing angles before roughly tracing over it and cleaning up the linework. I intend on using this method for other 
        entities in the game that need to be drawn from different viewing angles in order to maintain 3-dimensional accuracy.

      <h1>What's next</h1>
      <p>
        There is much more to this project than what I've covered here, and I plan on adding more information and screenshots when I get the chance. Some 
        topics I want to discuss in the future include the game design plan, the logic behind entity pathfinding, seamless room transitions, my custom 
        dialogue system, more shader stuff, and the large amount of cut-content that has accumulated along the way.
